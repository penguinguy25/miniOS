Welcome to miniOS! This is a text-based OS simulation made in Python for fun.
It contains a text editor, file manager, to-do list, calculator, minigames, unit converter, link opener and a simulated terminal for running cool commands!
To use miniOS, make sure you already have Python installed on your computer, navigate to the miniOS folder in your terminal and run the file with "miniOS.py". Next (optional), go to https://www.weatherapi.com/ to receive an API key which you will later use. After you've done this, copy the API key into the .env file of the miniOS folder (there will be a placeholder for it asking you to put the API key, just remove the placeholder and replace it with your key), save everything and rerun the file. Now you have access to weather functions!

IMPORTANT: The boot command is "on"!

Version 0.0.2 is out, here's what's new:\n
-Added to-do list reminders (you can turn on reminders for a certain note, making it so that you get reminders for that note occasionally while using miniOS)\n
-Changed the date format to H:M:S d/m/Y
-Added time and fulltime functions to MiniCustom
-Added the "msay" function to MiniCustom (works like echo)
-Added weatherc and weatherf functions to MiniCustom (gives the weather in the given location in either Celsius or Fahrenheit degrees)
-Added wiki and wikitopic functions to MiniCustom (wiki searches up the given information on Wikipedia, while wikitopic gives you a list of available/similar topics)
-Added minifetch function (works like neofetch on bash, will get an update as it doesn't have good support for Linux distros)

This was a big MiniCustom update!
Enjoy miniOS!
