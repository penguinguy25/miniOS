This is version 0.0.1 of miniOS (first release)

miniOS is a CLI simulated experience of an actual OS made in python as a fun project. It comes with a few programs including a text editor and file manager, minigames, a calculator and even an app where you can run commands like *files* (displays all current files). Future updates include adding more apps, maybe an AI assistant app by making the use of APIs, bug fixes, customizability on error messages, better consistency and more.

IMPORTANT: The boot command is "on"! (you can also shutdown miniOS from the boot screen)

Enjoy miniOS!
